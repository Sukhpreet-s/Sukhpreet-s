  <em>We were on our way home after a week of sports in Stavelot (Belgium), It was around 8:00pm in the evening. After a 20 minutes ride we stopped the car to enjoy the beautiful view. I made this photo without a filter but did a small edit in Lightroom. For everyone who loves sports and nature, go to the Belgium Ardennes.</em>
