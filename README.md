  <em>I visited this wonderful village outside of the historical and wonderful town of Hoi An, Vietnam.  The villagers are very friendly and proud of what they do.  What makes Tra Que village special is no chemical or toxic used in the plant growing process. It is to guarantee the best quality of vegetables.   The herbs also have a natural fragrant smell thanks to the seaweed manure from ƒê·∫ø V√µng lake.

A great place to visit on any trip to Hoi An.</em>
