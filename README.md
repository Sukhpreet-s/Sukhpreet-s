  <em>mountain covered with snow under cloudy sky</em>
  
  <em>Last year I quit my job to travel around the world and I started learning about photography. I switched from sitting in front of a desk to sit in front of mountains.  One destination that changed my life was Patagonia, I’ve never seen so much beauty around me. I was amazed how all the forces, elements, atoms on this universe come together to create beautiful things like this everyday. 

I printed this image and have it hanging on my room to remind me the beautiful world we live in.

I hope you like it as much as I like it</em>
