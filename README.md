  <em>white patio umbrella near body of water</em>
  
  <em>I was on Tsia, an island in Greece, on my 9th day of travel, and I thought this picture captured the essence of summer perfectly - we try to be on the beach trying to beat the heat, relaxing, taking a break from work, having a drink.. And this beautiful afternoon in a not-so-touristy place with a few heads bobbing in the sea reflect that exact calmness which the word ‘summer’ exudes</em>
