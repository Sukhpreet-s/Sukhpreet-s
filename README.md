  <em>This shot was well worth the wait. We studied the landscape and discovered this grove of Joshua Trees that would face directly into the setting sun. We waited for about 2 hours for the sunset to reach it’s peak and we saw the wonderful rays of light shining through the warped limbs. Such a peaceful moment.</em>
